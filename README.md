# Resume Enhance

Resume Enhance is an open-source resume builder designed to help you create professional, high-impact resumes. It simplifies the process of crafting clear and effective content.

You can import an existing resume or start from scratch. The application provides smart feedback to refine your bullet points using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result), ensuring your achievements are presented clearly. Once done, you can export your resume as a high-quality PDF.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Smart Enhancement**: Automatically restructure your experience using the STAR format for maximum impact.
*   **Resume Dashboard**: Manage multiple resumes, duplicate specific versions, or delete old ones.
*   **PDF Import**: Upload your existing LinkedIn PDF resume to get started immediately.
*   **Live Preview**: See how your resume looks in real-time before exporting.
*   **PDF Export**: Download a professional, ATS-friendly PDF (currently supports FaangPath template).
*   **User Accounts**: Sign up, log in, and save your work securely.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run this project using Docker (recommended) or manually in your terminal.

### Prerequisites

*   **OpenAI API Key**: You need a key to use the AI features.
*   **Docker**: For the easiest setup.
*   **Python 3.10+ & PostgreSQL**: If running manually.

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koksalkapucuoglu/resume-enhance.git
cd resume-enhance
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create your `.env` file by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env_copy .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the values:

```env
# Required (Get one from OpenAI)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Required for Django Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True

# Database URL (Default for Docker is fine)
# If running manually, set this to your local Postgres DB
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db_name
```

### 3. Option A: Run with Docker (Recommended)

This serves both the app and the database automatically.

```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Run the project
make run
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

To stop the app:
```bash
make down
```

### 4. Option B: Run Manually (Terminal)

If you prefer running without Docker, you need to have **PostgreSQL** running locally.

1.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run Migrations**
    Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points to your local Postgres database.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Run the Server**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
